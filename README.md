===============================
##Introduction
This is my simple frogger clone for project 3 of Udacity's frontend nanodegree

### Getting Started
- First clone or download the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pmillssf/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
- Then open **index.html** in a browser window to launch the game

### Game Play
- Your avatar can move around the screen using the arrow keys
- To win move your avatar across the grass and rocks to reach the river!
- Once you've made it, the game resets
- If you get hit by, or hit a, bug, the game will resets

### Check Back
- I plan on adding more features to the game later, so check back for updates!
